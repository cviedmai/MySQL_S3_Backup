2 scripts to create a full backup and an incremental backup of a MySQL database into a S3 (Amazon AWS) bucket. They can be easily setup as cron tasks to be done daily.

MySQL binary logging must be enabled. For that make sure the MySQL config file (my.cnf normally under /etc/mysql/) has the following line in it:

log_bin = /var/db/mysql/binlog/mysql-bin

The path must match with that in the config.rb file.
